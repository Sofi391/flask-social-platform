## ✨ Project Overview

Flask Social Platform simulates a **real-world social media/blogging environment**, allowing users to:

- Publish posts and rich-formatted content
- Engage with posts through comments and likes
- Receive in-app and email notifications for interactions
- Manage profiles and personal content
- Experience role-based access (User, Admin, Super Admin)

The platform emphasizes **backend concepts** such as secure authentication, relational data management, query optimization, and filtering.

Admins can moderate content, manage users, and ensure platform quality. The project demonstrates **production-ready practices**, though it is primarily educational to showcase backend growth and framework versatility.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd flask_socials
```

2. **Create virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Configure environment variables**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your credentials:
```
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///posts.db
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
```

5. **Run the application**
```bash
python main.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Email Setup
For Gmail SMTP:
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Google account
2. Generate an App Password: Google Account → Security → App Passwords
3. Use the generated password in `EMAIL_PASSWORD`

### Database
The application uses SQLite by default. The database is automatically created on first run.
